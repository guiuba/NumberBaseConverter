# NumberBaseConverter
This is my solution to a Jet Brains Academy project,  my second wrote in Kotlin.
Converts numbers from and to any base. Especially designed to work with large fractional numbers.
Even after already done a very similar project in Java track this was hard especially at 4/4 stage. It was worth to learn to do it in Kotlin + using BigDecimals an BigIntegers. Tks JBA Team
